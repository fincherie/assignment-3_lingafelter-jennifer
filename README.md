## Comments and Feedback
Following along is very helpful and having the step-by-step instructions is great. Now that we have exposure to GitHub, the repo, the terminal and Atom, it would help to have an overview again of what we are doing in reference to how we used to code locally and then upload it to our hosting site and now, we are coding in Atom and then pushing (uploading) it to Github and what impact does that have on Atom locally?
